Problem Statement: 
Everyone is fond of fashion now a days. Whenever we go out we focus more on clothes we wear. Fashion is very important for this generation. Everyone is very conscious for their fashion sense. Fashion has the ability to change and shape lives through its personal connection to us all. We all have to wear clothes and every piece of clothing we buy represents a personal choice – it is this intrinsically human relationship between us and our fashion that makes it political. 
So, by introducing a new system which will give you idea of all the trendy fashion and it will also give you the idea that which outfit will suit your personality.

Conclusion: 
Technology has made significant progress over the years to provide consumers a better online shopping experience and will continue to do so for years to come.  With the rapid growth of products and brands, people have speculated that online shopping will overtake in-store shopping.  While this has been the case in some areas, there is still demand for brick and mortar stores in market areas where the consumer feels more comfortable seeing and touching the product being bought.  However, the availability of online shopping has produced a more educated consumer that can shop around with relative ease without having to spend a large amount of time.  In exchange, online shopping has opened up doors to many small retailers that would never be in business if they had to incur the high cost of owning a brick and mortar store.  At the end, it has been a win-win situation for both consumer and sellers.
